This is my very first blog post on my very first blog, which I created on GitHub. It's been an exciting journey so far, learning about git. There is more to learn and experience about GitHub, the furture, hopefully, wil be exciting with new opportunities to learn more about GitHub, as well as, other courses involving computers. I'm also working on getting my compTIA A+, Nwtwork + and Security + certifications along with Cisco CCNP certifications as well.
